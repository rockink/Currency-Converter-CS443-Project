This app requires runtime request for the use of internet and then access to the file.

But, if we just click on green icon on android studio it should work.

The gradle has been changed to newer version, which was caused by hw4. We stick with it
because it worked for us.

But basically, we did not do anything than just click on green arrow icon on the
Android Studio.

In windows, we tried running this, and we got an error,
Android SDK not found or sth.

To solve this, we went tools -> Android -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.


So, it should work properly.




The project report is in ProjectReport.pdf file.
